# Demand_Forecasting_Application : Web based prototype application to forecast the demands

Shortages – Is one such word which every stakeholder in the supply chain industry comes across – be it a Buyer / Logistics Coordinator / Production Supervisor.

Forecasting is an art of being less wrong - better forecasting with machine learning models can certainly help in reducing the shortages to a great extent. 

In this next use case of #SCMunfolds , I would like to showcase a prototype model for Demand Forecasting using Machine Learning.

This model compares various regression / time series techniques to forecast the demands based on the historical data patterns predicting the best model to be used with highest level of accuracy among all.

Being a prototype , a very limited data is being displayed in this model , we can however explore it to the level desired.



Input Screen : Select the slider to decide how many days of data you want to predict.
